# What is License?
A license is a legal agreement that determines how other people can use, modify, and distribute your code. It provides you with a set of permissions that you grant to others who want to use your code, as well as limitations on how they can use it.
When you create a repository on GitHub, you have the option to choose a license for your code. GitHub offers a variety of open source licenses, such as the MIT License, the Apache License 2.0, and the GNU General Public License (GPL), among others. These licenses have different terms and conditions, but they generally allow others to use and modify your code, as long as they give you credit for your original work and adhere to the terms of the license.
By choosing a license for your code, you make it clear to others what they can and cannot do with your code, which can help protect your work and ensure that it is used in a responsible and ethical manner. It is important to choose a license that aligns with your goals for your project and your values as a developer.
# Some different types of license:
# 1.MIT
# 2.BSD
# 3.APACHE

# 1.MIT:
The MIT License is a permissive open source software license that is widely used for software projects, including those hosted on GitHub. It is a simple, short, and liberal license that allows people to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of a software package, without restriction.
The MIT License is often preferred by developers because it allows them to share their code with others while retaining minimal control and responsibility over how it is used. Under the MIT License, users of the software are not required to disclose the source code or provide any attribution to the original author, although they are encouraged to do so.
The text of the MIT License is relatively brief and easy to understand, and it has been used as a model for other permissive licenses, such as the BSD License and the Apache License. Here is the text of the MIT License:

MIT License

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

This license essentially grants users of the software broad permissions to use and modify the code, while also disclaiming any liability or warranty on the part of the software's original author.

# 2.BSD:
The BSD License is a permissive open source software license that allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute software, with very few restrictions. The BSD License is named after the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix-like operating system that was developed at the University of California, Berkeley.

The BSD License is similar to the MIT License in that it is a permissive license that allows users to do almost anything they want with the software. However, the BSD License also includes a clause that requires users to include a copy of the original copyright notice and disclaimer in any distributions of the software. This clause is often referred to as the "BSD advertising clause."

The BSD License comes in several different versions, each with slightly different wording and requirements. The most commonly used versions are the 2-clause BSD License (also known as the FreeBSD License) and the 3-clause BSD License (also known as the New BSD License).

Here is the text of the 3-clause BSD License:

# APACHE:
The Apache License is a permissive free software license written by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). The Apache License is a widely used software license that grants permission to users to use, distribute, and modify software released under the license, with or without their own modifications. The license is designed to encourage collaboration and a community-driven software development model.
Under the Apache License, users are allowed to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software, as well as distribute modified versions of the software. The license also allows for the use of any patents held by the software's authors, making it a very flexible license. Additionally, the license requires that any modified software be clearly labeled as such, and any changes made to the software must be documented.
The Apache License has been adopted by many open-source software projects, including the Apache HTTP Server and the Hadoop data processing framework. It is one of the most popular open-source licenses in use today.
